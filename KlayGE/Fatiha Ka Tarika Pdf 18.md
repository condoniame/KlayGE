1. Make an intention (niyyah) in your heart that you are reciting Surah Al-Fatiha for the sake of Allah and for the benefit of the deceased person.
2. Recite Surah Al-Fatiha with sincerity and devotion. You can recite it silently or aloud, depending on the situation.
3. After finishing Surah Al-Fatiha, say "Ameen" and then send salutations (salawat) upon Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) by saying "Allahumma salli ala Muhammadin wa ala ali Muhammadin wa sallim".
4. Then, make dua (supplication) for the deceased person, asking Allah to forgive their sins, grant them mercy, elevate their status, and admit them to Paradise. You can use any words that you like, or follow some of the recommended duas from the Quran and Sunnah.
5. Finally, end your Fatiha by saying "Alhamdulillah" (all praise is due to Allah) and "Subhanallah" (glory be to Allah).

You can repeat this process as many times as you wish, for as many deceased persons as you want. You can also perform Fatiha for living people who are in need of Allah's help and guidance.
 
## How to Perform Esal-e-Sawab
 
Esal-e-Sawab is a way of sharing the rewards of your good deeds with the souls of the dead. It is based on the belief that Allah is generous and merciful, and that He accepts the intercession of His servants for each other. Esal-e-Sawab can be done by performing any act of worship or charity that is pleasing to Allah, such as:

- Reciting Quran or other Islamic books
- Offering prayers (salah) or fasting (sawm)
- Giving charity (sadaqah) or alms (zakat)
- Performing pilgrimage (hajj) or minor pilgrimage (umrah)
- Visiting the sick or helping the needy
- Taughting Islamic knowledge or spreading Islamic message
- Making dua or dhikr (remembrance of Allah)

The steps for performing Esal-e-Sawab are similar to those for performing Fatiha, except that you have to make an intention (niyyah) in your heart that you are doing this act of worship for the sake of Allah and for the benefit of the deceased person. You can also specify the name of the person or persons whom you want to receive the rewards. After completing your act of worship, you can make dua for them as well.
