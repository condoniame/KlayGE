# How to Use KMS Client Emulator V10 to Boost Your KMS Server Client Count
  
KMS, or Key Management Services, is a technology that allows you to activate multiple Windows and Office products with a single product key. This can save you time and money, as well as simplify your license management. However, to use KMS, you need to have a KMS host server that is activated with a KMS host key, and a minimum number of KMS clients that connect to the host server for activation.

Depending on the product and edition, the minimum number of KMS clients can vary from 5 to 25. This means that if you have fewer than the required number of clients, your KMS host server will not activate them. This can be a problem if you have a small network, or if you want to test KMS activation before deploying it to a larger network.
  
Fortunately, there is a solution: KMS Client Emulator V10. This is a tool that can emulate multiple KMS clients on a single computer, and increase the client count on your KMS host server. By using this tool, you can activate your Windows and Office products with KMS, even if you have only one or a few real clients.
  
## How to Use KMS Client Emulator V10
  
To use KMS Client Emulator V10, you need to download it from [this link](https://soundcloud.com/aforlacacit/kms-client-emulator-v10-for-increasing-kms-server-client-count). The tool is a portable executable file that does not require installation. You can run it from any location on your computer.
  
Before you run the tool, make sure you have installed the Generic Volume License Key (GVLK), or KMS client key, on your computer. This is the product key that tells your computer to use KMS for activation. You can find the GVLKs for different Windows and Office products [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/kms-client-activation-keys). You can install the GVLK using the command `slmgr /ipk ` in an elevated command prompt.
  
After you have installed the GVLK, run the KMS Client Emulator V10 tool as administrator. You will see a window like this:
  ![KMS Client Emulator V10 window](kms_client_emulator_v10.png)  
In the tool window, you can configure the following options:
  
- **KMS Server IP/Name**: Enter the IP address or hostname of your KMS host server.
- **KMS Server Port**: Enter the port number of your KMS host server. The default port is 1688.
- **KMS Client Count**: Enter the number of fake clients you want to emulate. The maximum number is 1000.
- **KMS Client Interval**: Enter the interval in seconds between each fake client activation request. The default interval is 30 seconds.
- **KMS Client Mode**: Choose whether you want to emulate Windows or Office clients.
- **KMS Client Edition**: Choose which edition of Windows or Office you want to emulate.
- **KMS Client Version**: Choose which version of Windows or Office you want to emulate.
- **KMS Client Language**: Choose which language of Windows or Office you want to emulate.
- **KMS Client Architecture**: Choose whether you want to emulate 32-bit or 64-bit clients.

After you have configured the options, click on **Start Emulation**. The tool will start sending activation requests to your KMS host server, and increase the client count. You can see the status of each request in the log window below. You can also see the current client count on your KMS host server by running the command `slmgr /dlv` on the host server.
  
To stop the emulation, click on **Stop Emulation**. The tool will stop sending requests, and the client count will gradually decrease as the fake clients expire. You can also close the tool window at any time.
