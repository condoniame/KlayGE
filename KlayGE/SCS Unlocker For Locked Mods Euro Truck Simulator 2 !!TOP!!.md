## How to Unlock Locked Mods for Euro Truck Simulator 2

1. Download the SCS Unlocker tool from the link above and extract it to a folder on your PC.
2. Copy the locked mod file that you want to unlock to the same folder where you extracted the SCS Unlocker tool.
3. Open the SCS Unlocker folder and run the D.A.R.T.exe file as administrator.
4. Select the locked mod file from the list and click on Extract.
5. The tool will ask you for a password. If you know the password, enter it and click OK. If you don't know the password, leave it blank and click OK.
6. The tool will try to extract the contents of the locked mod file to a new folder with the same name as the mod file.
7. If the extraction is successful, you will see a message saying "Done!" and a new folder with the extracted files will appear in the SCS Unlocker folder.
8. If the extraction fails, you will see an error message saying "Failed!" and no new folder will appear. This means that the mod file is encrypted with a strong password that cannot be cracked by the tool. In this case, you will have to contact the mod creator and ask for their permission or find another mod that is not locked.
9. If you managed to extract the mod files, open the new folder and look for a file called manifest.sii. This file contains information about the mod, such as its name, version, author, description, etc.
10. Open the manifest.sii file with Notepad++ or another text editor and make any changes that you want. For example, you can change the version number of the mod to match the current version of your game or change other settings. Be careful not to change anything that might break the mod or cause errors in your game.
11. Save and close the manifest.sii file when you are done editing it.
12. Select all the files in the new folder and compress them into a new SCS file using WinRAR or 7-Zip. You 8cf37b1e13
