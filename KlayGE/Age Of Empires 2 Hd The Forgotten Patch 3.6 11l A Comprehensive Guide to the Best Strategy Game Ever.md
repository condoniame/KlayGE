## How to Play Age Of Empires 2 Hd The Forgotten?
 
Age Of Empires 2 Hd The Forgotten is a real-time strategy game where you control a civilization from the Dark Age to the Imperial Age. You can play as one of the 18 civilizations available, each with its own unique units, buildings, technologies, and bonuses. You can also choose from four different game modes: Random Map, Death Match, Regicide, and Treaty.
 
In Random Map mode, you start with a randomly generated map and a few villagers. You have to gather resources, build your base, research technologies, train your army, and fight against other players or AI opponents. You can win by either destroying all enemy units and buildings, or by building a Wonder and defending it for a certain amount of time.
 
In Death Match mode, you start with a large amount of resources and a pre-built base. You have to quickly create a powerful army and attack your enemies before they do the same. The game ends when one player is eliminated or resigns.
 
In Regicide mode, you start with a King unit that represents your leader. You have to protect your King at all costs, while trying to assassinate the enemy Kings. The game ends when one player loses their King or resigns.
 
In Treaty mode, you start with a peace period that can last from 10 minutes to 4 hours. During this time, you cannot attack or be attacked by other players. You can use this time to build up your economy and military without any interference. After the peace period ends, the war begins and you have to defeat your enemies using your prepared forces.
